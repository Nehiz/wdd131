            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <p><strong>Pi and Beads</strong></p>
            <p>The name "Pi and Beads" reflects the core focus of the site: combining the mathematical concept of "Pi"
                (symbolizing math and logic) with "Beads" (representing the abacus, a tactile learning tool). The
                inclusion of AI and coding in the program adds a modern tech dimension, making it a holistic learning
                experience for kids. I chose this name because it’s memorable, playful, and ties to the educational
                themes of abacus math, coding, and AI, appealing to both parents and children.</p>

        <section id="site-purpose">
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of the Pi and Beads website is to promote an interactive learning program for kids that
                combines AI, coding, and abacus math. The site will serve as a hub for parents to learn about the
                program’s benefits, explore the AI, coding, and abacus math tracks, and request more information via a
                contact form. It will provide detailed program information, interactive features like a quiz and coding
                demos, and a gallery of kids engaging with the tools, all designed to engage and inform the target
                audience.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="scenarios">
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>These scenarios represent questions that parents (my target audience) might ask when visiting the site:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What are the benefits of the abacus math program for my 7-year-old, and what age group is it
                        best suited for?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>What kind of coding projects will my child learn, and can I see an example of a project they
                        might create?</strong></li>
                <li><strong>How does the AI track introduce artificial intelligence to kids, and what simple AI concepts
                        will my child explore?</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="color-schema">
            <h2>Color Schema</h2>
            <p>The site will use a bright, playful color scheme to appeal to kids and parents, while ensuring
                accessibility through high contrast ratios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sky Blue (#4A90E2)</strong>: Used for headers, navigation bar background, buttons, and
                    accents to create a friendly, approachable feel, reflecting the tech aspect of AI and coding.</li>
                <li><strong>Sunshine Yellow (#F5A623)</strong>: Used for call-to-action buttons (e.g., "Take the Quiz"),
                    highlights, and hover effects to add energy and draw attention, symbolizing the creativity of
                    learning.</li>
                <li><strong>White (#FFFFFF)</strong>: Used for the main background to ensure readability and contrast
                    with text and colored elements.</li>
                <li><strong>Dark Gray (#333333)</strong>: Used for body text and footer text to ensure high contrast
                    against the white background.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These colors are applied in this site plan document to demonstrate their usage.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="typography">
            <h2>Typography</h2>
            <p>The site will use two fonts to balance readability and playfulness:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poppins (400, 700 weights)</strong>: Used for headings (e.g., h1, h2, h3) to create a
                    modern, rounded look that’s kid-friendly. Weight 400 for regular headings and weight 700 for
                    emphasis (e.g., page titles).</li>
                <li><strong>Open Sans (400 weight)</strong>: Used for body text and paragraphs to ensure high
                    readability, especially for parents reading program details.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These fonts are applied in this site plan document to demonstrate their usage.</p>
